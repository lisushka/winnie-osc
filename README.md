## Questions

* **Q:** Why do you smile and laugh at random points during the talk that don't make sense?  
**A:** I met [Artemis Mu√±oz](https://www.artemismunoz.com/), the actor and videographer who was behind the camera for this talk, through National Novel Writing Month.  A few aspects of the talk reference features and events that Art was involved in or around for.  Both of us have very expressive faces, so it was hard not to react in visible ways.
